# Java Programs Snippets 🚀 #

A collection of standalone Java programs I’ve been building, practicing, and pushing over time.
This repo serves as a learning archive as well as a reference library for anyone exploring Java Basics, DSA, OOP, and General Problem-Solving and also the advacnce topic like Muti-Threading, Garbage-Collection, OverRiding, OverLoading, Inheritence, Collection-FrameWork File-IO-Operations and Exception-Handling. Also it contains all the Advance Java JDBD , Servlet Programming snippit So i think it help a Lot.

- Core Java Programs → Basics, loops, conditionals, Funtions, Operator, Arthematics And keywords.
- OOP Concepts → Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interfaces, OverRidding, OverLoading And Constructor.
- DSA Implementations → Sorting, Searching, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs.  
- Utility Programs → File handling, String manipulations, Number conversions, GarbageCollection, ExceptionHandling, Try-Catch-Finally, IO-Operations etc.
> Each program is written as a **standalone `.java` file** so you can run them independently.
